##  1.1 FOCUS AREA : Experimentation
### 1.2 About the Experiment :
A demultiplexer is a logic circuit with one input and multiple outputs. It connects a single data input line to one of the 2^m output lines based on the status of the (m) select lines. The students will be able to understand the concept of demultiplexers/decoders and its implementation using combinations of basic logic gates.

### 1.3 Learning Objectives & Cognitive Levels :

|Sr. No. |Learning Objective |Cognitive Level |Action Verb|
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1. | Students will be able to identify the type of gates required for 1:2 demultiplexer | Remember | Identify  |
| 2. | Students will be able to identify the Boolean expression for the 1:2 demultiplexer. |  Remember  | Identify |
| 3. | The student will be able to explain the role of demultiplexer in a water dispenser system. | Apply | Explain |
| 4. | The student will be able to construct the function table of the operation of a 1:2 demux.  | Apply | Construct |
| 5. | The student will be able to pick and place the required gates on canvas and construct the 1:2 demux logic. | Apply | Construct |
| 6. | The student will be able to apply appropriate combinations of enable, select and inputs to the 1:2 demux circuit. | Apply | Apply |
| 7. | The students will be able to examine the truth table of decoder and verify the same.|Analyze|Examine |


## 2.1. Instructional Strategy : Problem Based
### 2.2. Assessment Method : Formative Assessment
### 2.3. Description of sections :
It is proposed to design this experiment using a generalized simulator. The simulator would be a framework that provides logic gates, switches, LEDs and wire options, reset, simulate and pick and place features. These features would enable the students to construct, simulate and verify their digital logic designs.<br>
